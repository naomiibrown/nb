Step-by-Step Execution
1. Prepare Your Development Environment
Set up Eclipse with Hadoop:

Install the Hadoop Eclipse plugin if not already installed

Configure the Hadoop location in Eclipse (Window > Preferences > Hadoop Map/Reduce)

Create a Java Project:

File > New > Java Project

Name it "MusicAnalysis" or similar

Add the Hadoop libraries to your build path

2. Add Your Code Files
Create two packages in your project:

MusicUnique (for both classes)

Add your Java files:

Music1.java

TrackShared.java

3. Prepare the Input Data
Upload your music dataset to HDFS:

bash
hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/cloudera/music_input
hdfs dfs -put local_music_data.csv /user/cloudera/music_input
4. Run the Programs
For Music1.java (Unique Listeners):
Export as JAR:

Right-click project > Export > Java > JAR file

Select both classes, name it "MusicAnalysis.jar"

Choose a location to save

Run on Hadoop:

bash
hadoop jar MusicAnalysis.jar MusicUnique.Music1 /user/cloudera/music_input /user/cloudera/music_output_unique
For TrackShared.java (Track Sharing):
Use the same JAR file:

bash
hadoop jar MusicAnalysis.jar MusicUnique.TrackShared /user/cloudera/music_input /user/cloudera/music_output_shared
5. Check Results
View output for unique listeners:

bash
hdfs dfs -cat /user/cloudera/music_output_unique/part-r-00000
View output for track sharing:

bash
hdfs dfs -cat /user/cloudera/music_output_shared/part-r-00000
